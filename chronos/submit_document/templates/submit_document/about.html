				<p style="font-size:16px">	We are developing a web application which publishes a document hash to the Bitcoin blockchain, allowing users to prove the existence of data at a particular point in time. The Bitcoin network consists of a “ledger” replicated at every full node which contains a record of every bitcoin transaction. The Bitcoin network provides support for unredeemable transactions which contain accompanying data. We can insert a hash into this data section and the transaction will be kept in the bitcoin ledger and exist within the bitcoin network in perpetuity. Because Bitcoin blocks have known generation times and are publically available, users of our product can prove that they had possession of some data at a particular point in time. These are due to the unique properties of cryptographic hash functions: collision resistance, and pre-image resistance. Collision resistance means that a user’s data will not “accidentally” match a hash preexisting in the blockchain, and pre-image resistance means the data hashed cannot be recovered from the hash. Since the hash of the data is stored in the block chain rather than the actual data itself, this means the data is provably confidential. This concept allows users to stake a claim on their ideas without revealing to anyone what these ideas are. We plan to develop the web application using the Django framework with a Postgres backend, and write a Java application using the bitcoinj library to interact with the Bitcoin network and handle submitting Bitcoin transactions with the document hash on the backend.
